# Stock Portfolio Management System

## Made to help retail investors

The application will organize each user profile's stock holdings, allowing every profile 
created to enter information such as the stock name, stock price during buying and 
selling, and number of shares bought or sold for each
stock into their stock portfolio.

**Possible features include:**
- Displaying the total value of each stock holding.
- Calculating the value of each profile's stock portfolio based on each stock holding and transaction.
- Displaying the amount of gain/loss of the portfolio after each stock sale.
- A stock watchlist.
- A transaction history page.

 *After the course, the project will be refactored to display live stock data and news.*

The application is aimed towards anyone who is interested in the stock market and 
whose goal is to generate wealth through it. I'm interested in building this specific 
application because I'm also heavily invested in the stock market, particularly 
in the form of value investing. I want to build an application that tidily organizes each person's stock portfolio 
where all the information regarding their portfolio is easily accessible.
